# Channel-Encoding-using-Neural-Network
End-to-end deep learning for communication systems, i.e., the complete process
of training the embeddings for the messages, dense NN to convert the embeddings into
signal constellation and training the decoder to decode the received corrupted signal is carried
out at one go. These encoder-decoder systems can achieve bit error rates which come
close to practical baseline techniques if they are used for over-the-air transmissions. This is
promising since complex encoding and decoding functions can be learned on the fly without
extensive communication-theoretic analysis and design, possibly enabling future communication
systems to better cope with new and changing channel scenarios.
