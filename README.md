# Channel-Encoding-using-Neural-Network
We studied the paper "Deep Learning for Channel Coding via Neural Mutual Information Estimation", which tries to develop a neural network to learn efficient encoding scheme without knowing the channel probability distribution. Moreover, this encoder-decoder pair achieved average symbol error rate almost equal to 16-QAM.
